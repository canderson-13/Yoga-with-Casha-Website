                    <p>Hello and welcome to Yoga with Casha! My name is Casha, I am a Hatha and Vinyasa Yoga teacher based in London, England. I am certified with the Yoga Alliance to teach Yoga and Meditation, having completed a 200 hour Yoga teacher training and a 25 hour Meditation teacher training.<br><br>I first discovered yoga as a technique to manage and reduce stress while I was studying for exams at University, since then I’ve fallen in love with the practice and am now 5 years into my journey with yoga. While yoga and meditation are extremely effective ways to help with stress, I’ve learned that there is so much more that can be gained from practicing, than just calming the mind, and I’d love to share these amazing benefits with you! It’s a great way to stay fit and keep your body active if you sit down a lot during the day, release tension stored in the body, improve strength and flexibility, tune out of your mind and into your body, tapping into the vast knowledge and intuition that sits beyond the mind - the possibilities are really endless. I’m so passionate about holistic health and helping people to find balance both mentally and physically through yoga, to live a more connected and joyful life.<br><br>I studied Physics at University, love science and am super curious about the universe. I’m fascinated by the intersection of science and spirituality, there is so much that we still have to uncover about the universe and our existence. Yoga & Meditation have been incredible practices for me to challenge my understanding of science, what is possible, go deeper and develop my own understanding of my mind and body. I’m really excited about the research currently being done in Physics, particularly quantum and particle Physics that could challenge what we think to be true completely!<br><br>When I’m not teaching yoga I work an office job where I spend a lot of time sitting down in front of a computer. My yoga practice  has been really helpful for me in combatting pain, stiffness and bad posture caused by sitting so much. Practicing daily is also a great way to introduce some movement into the day, reduce stress and build a healthy routine. If you experience any of these common issues, I would love to work with you and show you how you could benefit from yoga.<br><br>I have experience teaching group classes as well as personally tailored one on one yoga sessions, that are specifically designed for the individual student with a focus on correct alignment and breathing. I’m currently creating short free videos for anyone that are available on my website/ youtube - accessible for beginners or more advanced practitioners - short practices to help introduce you to yoga and develop your own yoga practice. I’m also offering private sessions either for individuals or small groups, where I can travel to you (within London) and teach you in the comfort of your own home. If you’re interested in booking a private session or if you have any questions for me, please reach out either via email: yogawithcasha@gmail.com or instagram: @yogawithcasha.<br><br>My other passions include travelling, dogs, skiing, surfing, cooking, eating delicious nourishing food, spending time with loved ones, learning more about science, the universe and technology.<br><br>Yoga is for anyone and everyone can benefit from it, it has been so beneficial in my life so my mission here is just to share this practice with as many people as I can and hopefully make the world more kind and caring.</p>
